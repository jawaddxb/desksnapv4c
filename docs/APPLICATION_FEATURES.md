## Tips & Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Generation Mode

| Your Situation | Recommended Mode |
|----------------|------------------|
| Quick overview or pitch | **Concise** (5-8 slides) |
| Standard presentation | **Balanced** (10-12 slides) |
| Training or detailed topic | **Detailed** (15+ slides) |
| Specific text you want used | **Verbatim** |

### Working with Themes Effectively

1. **Let AI choose first** - The AI considers your topic when selecting themes
2. **Match theme to audience** - Business themes for corporate, creative for marketing
3. **Stay consistent** - Avoid changing themes mid-presentation
4. **Consider the venue** - Dark themes work better on screens, light themes for print

### Optimizing AI Image Prompts

**Do:**
- Be specific about subjects: "A modern glass office building at sunset"
- Include style cues: "minimalist illustration" or "cinematic photography"
- Specify mood: "warm and inviting" or "dramatic and bold"
- Mention composition: "close-up", "wide angle", "aerial view"

**Avoid:**
- Text in images: "sign that says WELCOME"
- Brand names: "Apple logo" or "Nike swoosh"
- Generic requests: "business image" or "technology picture"
- People's faces (results vary)

### Making the Most of Ideation

1. **Start broad** - Capture all ideas before organizing
2. **Use colors** - Color-code notes by type (facts, questions, ideas)
3. **Connect related notes** - Draw lines between connected concepts
4. **Trust the stages** - The guided workflow helps structure your thinking
5. **Review the journal** - See AI reasoning to understand suggestions

### When to Use Rough Drafts

Use the rough draft workflow when:
- The topic is important and needs careful review
- You want to refine image prompts before generation
- You're creating content for a critical presentation
- You want to use AI enhancements on specific slides

Skip rough drafts when:
- You need a quick presentation
- The topic is familiar and straightforward
- You plan to do extensive editing anyway
